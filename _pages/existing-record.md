Existing records can be opened from the search tab to be viewed and edited. You can select a record to edit from the list on the left or click a resource marker on the map and select the ![Edit button]({{site.url}}/assets/images/editButton.png) button from the window that opens to display the record.

The card tree of whichever record you choose to edit will be shown on the left, similarly to when you are creating a new record. You can navigate to any blank card and enter new data by clicking add the same as you would when creating a new record.

You can also edit already entered data by going to the created card, editing the entered information, and clicking the ![Save Edit Button]({{site.url}}/assets/images/saveEditButton.PNG) button.
