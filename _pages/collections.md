Collections are custom sets of concepts that are used in the dropdown lists and other suggested fields during data entry. Collections enable you to design your dropdown menus and give you greater control over how users will see the concept structure of your project. Thesauri are built by creating new concepts, whereas collections are created by adding existing concepts. A collection can be constructed from scratch or spawned from a thesaurus.
