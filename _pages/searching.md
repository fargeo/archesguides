The search tab in Arches is used to find and select resource models from your project. Search results are displayed in list form to the left and on the map to the right.

# Filtering
There are multiple parameters you can choose to filter your search results by. Multiple filters can be layered together to further narrow your results and all of the currently applied filters will be displayed in the search field. These filters can be inverted to exclude the queried field by clicking the colored box or removed independently by clicking the 'x' inside each filters colored box.

## By concept
Searching by concept functions like a typical search bar for all of the concepts in your projects Thesauri. As you type Arches will suggest possible concepts or resources that contain whatever text you have entered.

## By area
Searching by area allows you to sort results based on their geographical location. You can create an area around a point, line, or polygon and set the buffer distance from the boundary in which you want results to be included.

## By time
Time filters require you to select the type of time range you want to sort by from the appropriate resource model you're searching for. You can either enter a range in the time filter or select one from the time wheel.
